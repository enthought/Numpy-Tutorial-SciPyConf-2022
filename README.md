# SciPy 2022 Tutorial: Introduction to Numerical Computing With NumPy

#### Presented by: Logan Thomas, [Enthought, Inc.](https://www.enthought.com)

This repository contains all the material needed by students registered for the Numpy tutorial of [SciPy 2022](https://www.scipy2022.scipy.org/) on Monday, July 11th 2022.

For a smooth experience, you will need to make sure that you install or update your Python distribution and download the tutorial material _before_ the day of the tutorial.

## Running the Exercises the (recommended) Easy Way

## Running the Exercise Locally

### Install Python

If you don't already have a working python distribution, you may download Anaconda Python ([https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)).


### Install Packages

To be able to run the examples, demos and exercises, you must have the following packages installed:

- `ipython` (for running, experimenting, and doing exercises)
- `jupyter` (for access to the Jupyter Notebook web-based interactive computing platform)
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`
- `pillow`
- `pyqt`

If you are using Anaconda, you can use the Anaconda Prompt (Windows) or Terminal.app (macOS) to create an environment with the necessary packages:

1. Open the Anaconda Prompt or Terminal.app using the below instructions:
    - **Windows**: Click Start and search for "Anaconda Prompt". Click on the application to launch a new Anaconda Prompt window.
    - **macOS**: Open Spotlight Search (using Cmd+Space) and type "Terminal.app". Click on the application to launch a new Terminal.app window.   

1. Create a new Anaconda virtual environment by executing the below command in the application window you opened in step 1 above. You may be prompted to `Proceed([y]/n)?`. If so, type `y` and press `Enter`.

    ```
    $ conda create -n numpy-tutorial ipython jupyter matplotlib numpy pillow pyqt 
    ```

1. Navigate to the directory where you'd like to store materials for this tutoiral and download the materials from this GitHub repository by executing the below command. It will create a new folder named `Numpy-Tutorial-SciPyConf-2022/` with all the content you will need.

    ```
    $ git clone git@github.com:enthought/Numpy-Tutorial-SciPyConf-2022.git
    ```
    **NOTE**: If you are not familiar with Git, you can download a zipped archive of the material by clicking on this link: https://github.com/enthought/Numpy-Tutorial-SciPyConf-2022/archive/main.zip. Then, unpack the zipped archive into a directoy named `Numpy-Tutorial-SciPyConf-2022`. You may have to rename the unpacked directory to explicitly be `Numpy-Tutorial-SciPyConf-2022`.


1. To test your installation, please execute the `check_env.py` script in the python virtual environment where you have installed the requirements (from step 2 above).
 
    If you created an Anaconda environment using the instructions above, you can use the same application window that you opened in step 1, or launch the platform specific application again -- Anaconda Prompt for Windows or Terminal.app for macOS.
    Be sure to navigate to where you downloaded this GitHub repository and activate your conda environment *before* executing `python check_env.py`:

    ```
    # Example path to course materials (yours may differ)
    $ cd ~/Desktop/Numpy-Tutorial-SciPyConf-2022/
    
    $ conda activate numpy-tutorial
    
    $ python check_env.py
    ```

    You should see a window pop up with a plot that looks vaguely like a smiley face (as shown below).

## Tutorial Materials

This GitHub repository is all that is needed in terms of tutorial content. If you downloaded these materials in step 3 above, there is no need to do so again. If not, the simplest solution is to download the material using this link:

https://github.com/enthought/Numpy-Tutorial-SciPyConf-2022/archive/main.zip

If you are familiar with Git, you can also clone this repository with:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/enthought/Numpy-Tutorial-SciPyConf-2022.git
```

The above command will create a new folder named `Numpy-Tutorial-SciPyConf-2022/` with all the content you will need: the slides I will go through (`introduction_to_numerical_computing_with_numpy_manual.pdf`), and a folder of exercises.

## Additional Anaconda Resources
- [Managing environments](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)

  - To create an Anaconda environment from an existing `environment.yml` file:

    ```
    $ conda env create -f environment.yml -n numpy-tutorial
    ```

  - To remove an existing Anaconda environment:

    ```
    $ conda remove --name numpy-tutorial --all
    ```

- To completely uninstall Anaconda, see the "Uninstalling Anaconda" documentation [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/uninstall/).
